## Fall in Kansai: A Tour Leader's Perspective on Planning a Memorable Trip to Japan

As a tour leader and planner, my experience organizing the "Fall in Kansai" tour to Japan was both exciting and challenging. The tour, which took place from 28 October to 04 November 2019, was designed to showcase the best of Kansai region, focusing on three cities: Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara. In this article, I would like to share my experience and professional lessons learned as a tour leader and planner on this trip.

Our group of 16 participants began our journey in Osaka, where we explored the modern side of Japan. We visited popular destinations like Dotonbori and Namba, and also made a stop at the majestic Osaka Castle. As a tour leader, I learned the importance of ensuring that the itinerary is balanced and caters to the interests of different travelers. We made sure that there was a mix of activities and sights for everyone to enjoy.

The next stop on our tour was Kyoto, known for its traditional settings and rich cultural heritage. We visited the famous Fushimi Inari Shrine and the iconic Kiyomizudera Temple, which offered breathtaking views of the city. One of the key lessons I learned during this part of the tour was the importance of scheduling ample time for exploring and appreciating each location. This allowed us to soak in the sights and sounds of each destination fully.

Our final stop on the tour was Nara, where we experienced the natural beauty of Japan. We visited the Nara Park, home to over 1,000 wild deer, and the Kasuga Taisha shrine, which showcased the intricate architecture of ancient Japanese shrines. This part of the tour taught me the value of incorporating unique experiences that create lasting memories for travelers.

Overall, my experience as a tour leader and planner for the "Fall in Kansai" tour was a great learning opportunity. It taught me the importance of designing a well-balanced itinerary, allowing enough time for exploration, and incorporating unique experiences. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for travel with the participants, and I look forward to planning more exciting tours in the future.
