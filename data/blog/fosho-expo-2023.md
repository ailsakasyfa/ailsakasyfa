### **Celebrating Fashion Diversity: My Experience with Fo-Sho! Expo 2023**

Being part of the Secretarial division for Fo-Sho! Expo brings me immense joy as I share my memorable journey. In this role, I handled a variety of tasks, from managing project files to creating reports after the event. Little did I know that this initial involvement would lead to an even more exciting experience in 2023, as we successfully put together Fo-Sho! Expo – an innovative fashion and lifestyle event.

From July 7th to 9th, 2023, at Senayan Park Mall, Fo-Sho! Expo gathered fashion enthusiasts and professionals to spotlight urban street style and y2k fashion. Under the theme "Simple Style to Match Your Smile," the event stood as a platform for self-expression and inclusivity, emphasizing fashion's role in confidence and identity. The idea was that fashion is more than what we wear – it's a way to show who we are and feel confident.

Featuring 20 brands categorized into fashion, lifestyle, and accessories, the event engaged attendees with a mix-and-match shopping competition, "Fo-Sho Chitchat" sessions for exhibitors, complementary creative workshops, and nostalgic attractions like the "Games Corner." The y2k-themed "Photo Booth," interactive live music, and the unpredictable "Wheel Forfeit" added layers of excitement. Fo-Sho! Expo 2023 curated an immersive experience uniting fashion, creativity, and entertainment, transcending conventional showcases.

In my role as part of the Secretarial division, I took care of tasks such as preparing and sharing meeting plans, managing project records, handling event documents, and assisting with reports after the event. My goal was to ensure that everyone on the team had the information they needed and that everything ran smoothly. I also helped keep track of contracts, permits, and legal papers related to the event.
