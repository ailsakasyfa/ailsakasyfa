## Journey of Self-Discovery: My Study Abroad Experience in South Korea

I remember feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as I sat on the plane, staring out the window at the endless expanse of ocean below. I was about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime: studying abroad. Little did I know that this experience would change my life in ways I never could have imagined. From immersing myself in a new culture and gaining valuable language skills to receiving a world-class education and making lifelong connections, studying abroad was a journey of personal growth and self-discovery. Hi everyone! This is Ailsa. I am thankful for the chance to spend a semester studying at Ulsan College in South Korea as part of the IISMA (Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards) 2022 program, from August 2022 to January 2023. I was able to learn more about my desired fields: hospitality and tourism. Join me as I share my experience of studying abroad in South Korea.

## Academic Life

I was given the opportunity to gain a different perspective on education. As I discovered here in South Korea, many countries have different teaching styles and curricula. Ulsan College provided me with numerous activities both inside and outside of the classroom. Aside from receiving courses in hospitality and tourism, including some on MICE, I also received an introductory Korean class for foreigners, which really helped me survive speaking in everyday life in South Korea.

To put what I learned in class into practice, Ulsan College gave me the occasion to visitÂ  several hospitality-related businesses and attend MICE-related events. I went to Lotte Hotel and Resort Ulsan, South Korea's largest hotel group, for a hotel tour and to learn about table manners. I was also given the opportunity to work as a banquet server under the Lotte Hotel and Resort Ulsan at several big events, one of which is the 2022 National Female CEO Management Training Desk and Job Consultation for Female Entrepreneurs. In addition, I attended the 20th World Korean Business Convention Exhibition, the Ulsan Money Fair, and the 1st ULsan Global ODA Forum.

From all the things I learned, I got several certifications from the AHLEI (American Hotel & Lodging Educational Institute), specifically a certificate for completion of the Convention Management and Service course and a certificate for completion of the Professional Barista Program course. Other than that, a certificate from Lotte Hotel and Resort Ulsan was issued with a description of having completed a practical training course. Studying abroad allows me to access specialized programs that lead to certifications that may not be available at my home university, creating opportunities for my future career paths.

## Non Academic Life

One of the biggest benefits of studying abroad is the chance to immerse oneself in a different culture. I had the opportunity to participate in several festivals where I met people from all over the world. The festival is the International Festival Ulsan College, where I was able to introduce and sell Indonesian foods such as chicken satay, fried noodles (Indomie), and luwak coffee. Then there was the Ulsan Whale Festival, where I took part in a parade dressed in Padang-style Indonesian traditional attire, and the International Sport Festival 2022, where I played some games and cheered on Indonesian teams.

Not wanting to let the chance slip by, I took advantage of my time studying in South Korea by also discovering the country. I had the chance to explore different cities in South Korea. Some of them are excursion programs provided by Ulsan College. I visited Pohang, Gyeongju, Yangsan, Busan, and Seoul. I went to interesting places and tried new things while learning about South Korean culture and history. Some of them went to a cultural village, went skiing, and even went to concerts! As a fan of South Korean pop music, seeing the singer perform live is a huge treat. Overall, studying abroad has been a valuable journey for me, breaking down barriers and opening up many opportunities in both my personal and professional lives.
