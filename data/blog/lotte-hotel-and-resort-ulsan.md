## A Cultural Immersion: My Experience Working in the Hospitality Industry in South Korea

One of the valuable moments that I gained during my time studying in South Korea was the opportunity to work as a banquet server under Lotte Hotel and Resort Ulsan. Lotte Hotel and Resort is the largest hotel group in South Korea, and working with them provided me with a wealth of knowledge and experience. Specifically, I signed on as part of the banquet server team for several large events.

Among these events, I provided meal service for 100 VIP guests at the 2022 National Female CEO Management Training Desk and Job Consultation for Female Entrepreneurs, served 1,800 members at the 2022 Small and Medium Business Convergence Festival, and provided meal service for 2,000 Korean businessmen from 40 countries at the 20th World Korean Business Convention. Each event required approximately 8 hours of planning and preparation to ensure that everything was set up properly and that the guests received the best possible service.

Working as a banquet server gave me the chance to learn about every aspect of banquet planning and execution, from arranging tables and chairs to cleaning equipment and supplies. I also had the opportunity to serve a VIP table, which was an amazing experience. However, working in a professional environment was not without its challenges. Communication with coworkers and guests was difficult because the majority of them spoke Korean and I had to adapt quickly to the fast-paced work environment.

Despite these challenges, I was able to learn important skills such as communication, adaptation, networking, work ethic, and teamwork. These skills will undoubtedly be useful in my future career. Moreover, my experience as a banquet server at several of the conventions mentioned above allowed me to closely observe how a convention is implemented. To summarize, my time working as a banquet server at Lotte Hotel and Resort Ulsan has been truly unforgettable and I feel incredibly fortunate to have gained such valuable insight through this experience.
