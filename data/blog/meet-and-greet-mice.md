## My Role in Ensuring Safety and Success at Meet and Greet MICE 2021 

I had the opportunity to be part of the K3 (Health and Safety) division for Meet and Greet MICE 2021 at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta. This annual event aims to welcome new MICE students, connect them with alumni and lecturers, and provide an introduction to the world of MICE. My primary responsibility was to ensure the safety and health of the committee by preventing the risk of work accidents and work-related diseases.

The preparations for the event began in March 2021, eight months prior to its execution in November 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the event was held virtually via Zoom on November 13th, 2021, with the theme "MICETOPIA," providing a platform where participants completed various missions to gain insights into the future rise of the MICE industry. Despite the virtual format, it was an engaging and informative event for everyone involved.

The talk show session featured outstanding speakers, including Gerda Crista, S.ST from the Directorate of MICE at the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, and Agung Priyo Hartanto, S.S.T, the Event Production Lead of Narasi. Their insights and experiences in the MICE industry were invaluable to the participants.

As part of the K3 division, I played a vital role in the preparations for the event during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of my responsibilities was to conduct rapid tests for the committee to prevent the spread of the virus. It was a challenging task, but it was an essential preventive measure for everyone's safety.

Overall, my experience as part of the K3 division was an opportunity for me to contribute to the success of the event while learning about safety measures in a virtual setting. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to grow both personally and professionally.
