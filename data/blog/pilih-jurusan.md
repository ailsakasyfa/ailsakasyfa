In my seventh semester, I undertook the MSIB internship within the Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) Program at PT Pilihanmu Indonesia Jaya, facilitated by Kemendikbud. PT Pilihanmu Indonesia Jaya is a company with a focus on online psychology services and career guidance. Its flagship product, "Pilih Jurusan," offers affordable, high-quality online psychology tests and career coaching with professionals.

**Internship Overview: Immersing in Community, Event, and Partnership Dynamics**

Throughout my internship at “Pilih Jurusan,” I actively participated in the Community Event & Partnership Division, also known as "Commev.” This division manages three pivotal areas: Events, Community, and Partnerships. Engaging in meticulous event management, community outreach, and partnership cultivation provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the company's multifaceted operations.

**Connecting Communities: Beyond Boundaries**

Being involved in community outreach means handling two main groups. The first, "Paguyuban Keluarga Mahasiswa lokal," strategically collaborates with student family associations to promote education and career development. This includes reaching students beyond Jabodetabek and Java through roadshows and tryouts, introducing Pilih Jurusan's services. The second group is the "Community of Guidance Counseling Teachers," providing a platform for BK teachers nationwide to exchange information and experiences within the education counseling realm.

**Event Management: Crafting Experiences**

In the Event domain, three programs were managed. Firstly, "Student Ambassador 2.0," a three-month initiative with 12 high school students fostering partnerships, introducing products/services, and increasing brand awareness. Key activities included Piljurain Academy and Piljurian Talk. Secondly, "One Step Closer Training for BK Teachers 2.0," attended by 50 participants, aimed to enhance the readiness of Indonesian BK teachers, focusing on student career planning and the socialization of Pilih Jurusan's services. Lastly, the "GIlive" (Get Inspired Live) Instagram series, held four times, featured student speakers from Pilih Jurusan/HSKS Depok, providing valuable insights and inspiration.

**Building Partnerships: A Growth Catalyst**

Engaging in school acquisitions and fostering partnerships with media collaborators and sponsors defined my involvement in the Partnership initiatives. Regarding School Acquisition, Commev proactively visited 214 schools within two and a half months, successfully establishing partnerships with three potentially A-graded schools. Moving on to Media Partners & Sponsorship, collaborations materialized in executing two key events—Student Ambassador 2.0 and One Step Closer Training for BK Teachers 2.0. These collaborations involved partnerships with esteemed media partners such as Event Tik, Ikut Event, and Seputar.InfoID, along with sponsorship from Rahsa Nusantara, Emina, and Kahf.

**Knowledge and Skill Growth: Navigating Professional Terrain**

In conclusion, this internship significantly transformed my personal and professional growth, enhancing my abilities in project management, relationship building, and digital business and marketing through active engagement in diverse projects. The immersion deepened my comprehension of the education sector, furnishing me with crucial skills to navigate its ever-evolving landscape. This journey goes beyond a mere duty; it positions me to make substantial contributions to the dynamic realm of education and career guidance in Indonesia.
