## Conquering the Pandemic: My Experience as a Committee Member for KULUM MICE 2021

I am excited to share my experience as a committee member for KULUM MICE 2021, an annual seminar held by Politeknik Negeri Jakarta that discusses topics related to the MICE industry. As part of the program division, my responsibilities included designing and managing the event program, selecting topics, arranging speakers, and creating presentation materials. Our theme for this year's event was "How the MICE Industry Conquered the Pandemic.

Planning for the event commenced in March 2021, which was seven months before it took place in September 2021. Due to the pandemic, the event was held using the Zoom platform on September 30th, 2021. Despite the challenges, we were able to successfully organize and execute the event. I am proud to have been part of a team that was dedicated and worked hard to ensure that the event met the needs of participants and achieved its overall goals.

One of the highlights of the event was the opportunity to invite three distinguished speakers to share their insights and experiences. We were honored to have Mr. Firhan Abdul Salam, representing the Singapore Tourism Board, Mr. Gumilar Ekalaya, Plt. Kepala Dinas Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif DKI Jakarta, and Mr. Hosea Andreas Runkat, Chairman of The Indonesian Exhibition Companies Association (ASPERAPI), as our speakers. Their presentations were informative and engaging, and attendees had the opportunity to learn from their experiences and perspectives.

As a committee member, it was a great experience to be part of an event that provided a platform for learning, networking, and gaining insights into the MICE industry. The event was attended by a diverse audience, including students, professionals, and academics from various sectors. It was rewarding to see the positive feedback we received from participants and to know that our hard work had paid off.

In conclusion, being part of the program division for KULUM MICE 2021 was a memorable and rewarding experience. It was an opportunity to work with a dedicated team and to contribute to the success of an event that provided valuable insights into the MICE industry during these challenging times. I am grateful for the experience and look forward to contributing to future events.
