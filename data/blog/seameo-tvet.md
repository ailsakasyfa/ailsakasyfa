## Exploring E-Commerce with the Philippines: My SEAMEO TVET Virtual Exchange Program

Opportunities come in different shapes and sizes, and sometimes they arrive when we least expect them. This is exactly what happened to me when my lecturer informed me about the virtual exchange program offered by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization. At first, I was hesitant to join the selection process due to my busy lecturers schedule, but I eventually decided to register and try my luck. Little did I know that this would have a significant impact on me, allowing me to broaden my knowledge and skills.

The virtual exchange program was a collaboration between BISCAST (Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology) and PNJ (Politeknik Negeri Jakarta), hosted by SEAMEO TVET, and lasted for a month, from May 30th to June 24th, 2022. The main subject of the program was E-commerce courses. To my surprise, I was chosen as a representative of the Business Administration Department at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta.

During the program, I was able to expand my understanding of e-commerce and explore related topics such as photography, infographic design, website development, and online business. At the end of the program, the goal was to create an e-commerce website with a partner from the Philippines. So, along with my Philippine buddy, Alyssa, I worked on creating an e-commerce website, itâ€™s called Ailyssa, starting from identifying the products or services we wanted to sell, designing the website to include product images and descriptions, pricing, and customer reviews, and setting up payment processing. It was an enriching experience that helped me learn new skills.

Apart from academic growth, I was also able to exchange cultural experiences with my Filipino friends. I learned about Filipino cuisine, travel destinations, fashion trends, and even a little bit of the Tagalog language. Saying "Salamat po" (thank you) was a fun and interesting way to immerse myself in the culture.

The program provided a pleasant learning environment that improved my communication, teamwork, and time management skills, and allowed me to make new connections and friends. It helped me grow not only academically but also personally. Overall, I highly recommend participating in exchange programs to take advantage of opportunities and make the most of them.
