Opportunities come in different shapes and sizes, and sometimes they arrive when we least expect them. This is exactly what happened to me when my lecturer informed me about the virtual exchange program offered by The Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization. At first, I was hesitant to join the selection process due to my busy lecturers schedule, but I eventually decided to register and try my luck. Little did I know that this would be a life-changing experience that would allow me to broaden my knowledge and skills.

The virtual exchange program was a collaboration between BISCAST  (Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology) and PNJ (Politeknik Negeri Jakarta), hosted by SEAMEO TVET, and lasted for a month, from 30th May to 24th June 2022. The main subject of the program was E-commerce courses. To my surprise, I was chosen as a representative of the Business Administration Department at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta.

During the program, I was able to expand my understanding of e-commerce and explore related topics such as photography, infographic design, website development, and online business. At the end of the program, the goal was to create an e-commerce website with a partner, one from Indonesia and the other from the Philippines. So, along with my Philippine buddy, Alyssa, we worked on creating a website about fashion. It was an enriching experience that helped me learn new skills. 

What I enjoyed most about the program was the enjoyable learning environment, where I felt very welcomed by my classmates and lecturer. I was able to express my opinions freely and ask questions whenever I needed help. This helped me build my confidence in communicating in English. 

Apart from academic growth, I was also able to exchange cultural experiences with my Filipino friends. I learned about Filipino cuisine, travel destinations, fashion trends, and even a little bit of Tagalog language. Saying "Salamat po" (thank you) was a fun and interesting way to immerse myself in the culture.

Participating in this program helped me improve my communication, teamwork, and time management skills. It also provided me with new connections and friends. The supportive learning environment allowed me to grow not only academically but also personally.

Overall, If you are considering participating in a virtual exchange program, I highly encourage you to take the leap and do it. You won't regret it! Opportunities come and go, but it is up to us to make the most out of them. Who knows, just like me, you might discover something new that you were previously unaware of, and it could change your life for the better.
