I am pleased to share that, after being chosen as a representative of the exchange student from the Business Administration Department at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta, I have completed the virtual exchange student program between BISCAST (Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology) and PNJ (Politeknik Negeri Jakarta), which was hosted by the SEAMEO TVET (The Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization). E-commerce courses were offered as the main subject of the exchange program.

I felt very welcomed by my friends and lecturers during the program, which made the learning environment enjoyable. I was given the opportunity to express my opinion in every discussion, ask questions when I didn't understand, and get answers to my curiosity about the discussion material. I was also able to exchange cultural experiences with friends from the Philippines. I learned about Filipino cuisine, travel, fashion trends, and even a little Tagalog.

The very supportive learning environment allows me to grow not only academically but also personally. Aside from providing insight, this program assists me in improving my communication, teamwork, and interpersonal skills, as well as providing me with new connections and opportunities.
