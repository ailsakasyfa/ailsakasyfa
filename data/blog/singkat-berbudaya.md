## Celebrating Betawi Ora Typical Culture: My Experience as a PR in Organizing Singkat Berbudaya Cultural Festival


I had the opportunity to be involved in organizing Singkat Berbudaya as a member of the Public Relations division. This special event was held by MICE Politeknik Negeri Jakarta. My responsibilities focused on community partners, which included communicating with them, presenting decks to the community, and other related tasks.

An intense process started in December 2022 to prepare for the event. On January 21st, 2023, Singkat Berbudaya was successfully held at Alun-Alun Depok. This cultural festival celebrated the Betawi Ora typical culture, which originates from the city of Depok. The festival featured a wide range of activities, including traditional games, Betawi fashion shows, bazaars, and karaoke. The aim of the festival was to showcase and promote the unique and diverse culture of Betawi Ora Typical to a wider audience.

On the day of the event, I also served as the Liaison Officer, responsible for coordinating and ensuring the needs of DLHK (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup dan Kebersihan) Depok were met. Coordinating everything and ensuring that everything ran smoothly was a challenging task, but we managed to overcome the obstacles and achieve our goals.

Throughout the event, we received a positive response from attendees, and we exceeded our target of 1000 visitors by welcoming 4000 visitors. As a member of the Public Relations division, it was gratifying to see the successful outcome of our hard work and dedication.

In conclusion, being a part of the Public Relations division of Singkat Berbudaya was an enriching experience. It provided me with valuable insights into event management, community engagement, and public relations. Moreover, it was a fantastic opportunity to celebrate and promote the unique and diverse culture of Betawi Ora Typical. The successful outcome of this event was a testament to the collaborative efforts and dedication of everyone involved.
