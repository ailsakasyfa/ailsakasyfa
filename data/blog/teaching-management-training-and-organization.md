## Lessons Learned as a Project Officer: Coordinating a Teaching and Organizational Training Program for Anjangsana Sosial PNJ

Being chosen as a Project Officer for the Teaching Management Training and Organization (PMPO) of Anjangsana Sosial PNJ was an exciting opportunity for me. This annual event, which started in July 2021, aims to provide newly admitted students with teaching and organizational training. As the Project Officer, I was responsible for leading and coordinating all committee members, which consist of 7 divisions.

The event was held every Saturday from 30 October to 20 November 2021, via Zoom Meeting on the first two days and hybrid on the third day. With 120 participants, my main responsibility was directing, supervising, and evaluating the running of the event. It was a challenging task as I had to ensure that everything ran smoothly, from coordinating the speakers to ensuring that the participants were actively engaged.

One of the biggest challenges we faced during the event was adapting to the hybrid format. The first two days were held via Zoom Meeting, which meant that we had to ensure that all participants had access to the necessary technology and were familiar with the platform. On the third day, we held the event in a hybrid format, which presented a different set of challenges. We had to ensure that the participants who attended in person were safe and that the online participants could still engage in the event.

As the Project Officer, I had to work closely with the committee members to ensure that everything was in order. Each division had specific responsibilities, and it was my job to ensure that they were all working towards the same goal. It was important to maintain good communication, provide support where needed, and ensure that everyone was on track.

Overall, the experience of being a Project Project Officer for PMPO was both challenging and rewarding. It was an opportunity to work with a team of dedicated individuals and to make a positive impact on the lives of newly admitted students. I learned a lot about leadership, communication, and project management, and I look forward to using these skills in future endeavors.
